*All the results were the average value of ten runs. In each run, the 420intrinsic was split randomly as training, validation and test dataset (ratio: 0.8, 0.1, 0.1) using the random seed chosen from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512.

*The five evaluation metrics for the models are R2,RMSE,MSE,MAE,and MAPE.

1.The five predictive metrics for the five models after being combined with the composite descriptor mPC_CC.

2.The file "GNN_transfer_seeds.csv" records the performance metrics of the transfer model.

3.The file "xgb_mPC_seeds.csv" records the predictive performance metrics for the XGBoost model using only the composite descriptors.
