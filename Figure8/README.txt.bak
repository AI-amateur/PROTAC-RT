*All the results were the average value of ten runs. 

*The XGBoost model, along with the RF, FCNN and GNN transfer models, has made predictions on the 6testE dataset.

*Six compounds were measured for retention time under two different chromatographic conditions and then predicted.

*The evaluation metrics for the results are recorded using the following indicators:MRSE,MSE,MAE,MAPE,and MRE.
