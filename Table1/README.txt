*All the results were the average value of ten runs. In each run, the 420intrinsic was split randomly as training, validation and test dataset (ratio: 0.8, 0.1, 0.1) using the random seed chosen from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512.

*the top4 descriptors for XGBoost model are moe206,Path,Constitution and Charge.An extra chromatographic condition descriptor has been incorporated.

1.The file "xgb_comb.csv" records the predictive performance of XGBoost when combined with four types of descriptors and chromatographic condition descriptors.


2.The file "xgb_comb_average.csv" records the average predictive performance of XGBoost when combined with four types of descriptors and chromatographic condition descriptors.
