*All the results were the average value of ten runs. In each run, the 420intrinsic was split randomly as training, validation and test dataset (ratio: 0.8, 0.1, 0.1) using the random seed chosen from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512.

1.The file "4ml_reg_CC.csv" additionally records the predictive performance of the four models after incorporating chromatographic condition information as descriptors.

2.The file "fcnn_reg_CC.csv" additionally records the predictive performance of the fcnn after incorporating chromatographic condition information as descriptors.

3.The files "4ml_reg_CC_average.csv" and "fcnn_reg_CC_average.csv" respectively contain the average predictive performance of the four machine learning models and the fcnn deep learning model after incorporating chromatographic condition information as descriptors.
