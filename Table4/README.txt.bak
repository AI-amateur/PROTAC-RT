*SHAP calculations for the optimal descriptor combination.
*The optimal combination of fingerprints for this model is MOE206, Path, and Charge, with an additional chromatographic condition descriptor known as CC.


6Comp_shap_botR.csv" records the rotatable bonds data from the MOE206 descriptors of the selected six compounds. To study the impact of the number of rotatable bonds (b_rotR) on predictive performance, the selected comparative compounds have roughly the same chromatographic condition information(CC), Van der Waals surface areas(PEOE_PC+), and atomic charge states(PEOE_VSA+1).
